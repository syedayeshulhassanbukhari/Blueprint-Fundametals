## 📋 Overview

This project serves as a practical training ground for learning and mastering Blueprint visual scripting in Unreal Engine 5. The focus is on developing muscle memory through repetitive practice of core Blueprint concepts, patterns, and best practices.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Master Blueprint Fundamentals**: Variables, functions, events, macros, and flow control
- **Build Muscle Memory**: Develop intuitive understanding through repetitive practice
- **Learn Best Practices**: Clean node organization, commenting, and reusable code patterns
- **Understand Core Concepts**: Actor lifecycle, component communication, and event handling
- **Practice Common Patterns**: Input handling, timers, collision detection, and actor spawning

- Functions and custom events
- Flow control (Branch, Switch, ForEach, While)
- Math operations and string manipulation

### Actor & Component System
- Actor spawning and destruction
- Component creation and management
- Actor communication methods
- Parent-child relationships

### Input System
- Enhanced Input System (UE5)
- Input Mapping Contexts
- Input Actions and Modifiers
- Mouse and keyboard handling

### Common Gameplay Patterns
- Collision detection and responses
- Timers and delays
- Event dispatchers
- Interface implementation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.x installed
- Basic understanding of Unreal Engine interface
- Willingness to practice and experiment

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlueprintFundamental.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder

3. Double-click `BlueprintFundamental.uproject` to open in Unreal Engine

4. Open levels in `Content/ThirdPerson/` or `Content/VisualScripting/` to explore

## 📚 Learning Approach

This project follows a hands-on learning methodology:

1. **Study**: Review Blueprint concepts and documentation
2. **Practice**: Implement features from scratch repeatedly
3. **Experiment**: Modify and extend examples to test understanding
4. **Refine**: Optimize and clean up code following best practices
5. **Repeat**: Rebuild features without reference to build muscle memory

## 🎮 Example Blueprints

- **BP_Learn**: Core Blueprint fundamentals practice
- **BP_House**: Modular construction examples
- **BP_VisualHouse**: Visual scripting demonstrations
